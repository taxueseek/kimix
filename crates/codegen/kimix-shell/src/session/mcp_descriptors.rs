//! MCP descriptor mirror.
//!
//! Some templates read MCP metadata from an on-disk descriptor tree. Keep that
//! tree current as servers connect by (re)writing descriptors for connected
//! servers on every MCP tool-set change, not just at the first turn.
//!
//! Local MCP writes are upsert-only — folders for servers removed mid-session are
//! not pruned (cleaned on the next session's first-turn build); pruning against
//! an async-changing client set risks deleting a just-connected server's folder.
//!
//! Owning the descriptor I/O here keeps `acp_session.rs` thin.
